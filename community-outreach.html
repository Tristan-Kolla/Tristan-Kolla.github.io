        <h2>Exposcience Participation</h2>

        <p>
          I had the incredible opportunity to participate in the 38th edition of Exposcience at the Stewart Hall Cultural Centre on November 9 and 10. As part of the Darwin Room, I contributed to two interactive stations: a hand-washing station to demonstrate the importance of hygiene and an x-ray station to explore the fascinating world of medical imaging. It was an amazing experience to engage with visitors of all ages, share knowledge, and celebrate the wonders of science in a fun and accessible way.

      <h2>Monty Hall Problem Activity</h2>

      <p>
        As part of a Concordia University math outreach initiative, I developed and led an engaging activity centered on the Monty Hall Problem for high school students (grades 9-11). I designed the session to include a historical introduction, an interactive in-class experiment, and a guided discussion to uncover the counterintuitive solution. I created custom materials, such as activity cards, to facilitate hands-on participation and collected data during the experiment to compare with theoretical predictions. By explaining the underlying mathematics and fostering critical discussion, I ensured that students not only grasped the surprising results but also appreciated the broader implications of probability and decision-making.
