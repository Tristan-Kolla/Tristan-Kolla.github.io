        My undergraduate research focused on the dynamics of regime shifts in lake ecosystems, examining how predator-prey interactions and spatial complexity influence these transitions. Using a two-patch tri-trophic food web model, I explored how changes in key ecological drivers, such as dispersal rates and fishing effort, impact ecosystem stability. This work revealed the critical thresholds at which ecosystems transition between predator-dominant and forage-fish-dominant regimes. By integrating concepts like resilience and hysteresis, my findings aimed to inform sustainable management practices to prevent catastrophic and often irreversible changes in aquatic ecosystems.
