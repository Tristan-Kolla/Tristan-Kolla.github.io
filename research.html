      <h1>Metacommunity Stability</h1>
      <p>
      My master's research investigates how variations in dispersal and connectivity affect the stability of spatially structured metacommunities. By building on theoretical models, I aim to uncover how asymmetrical and non-uniform movement patterns influence population persistence and community dynamics. This work bridges ecological theory and application, offering new insights into the role of dispersal in stabilizing ecosystems under environmental variability and anthropogenic pressures.

      <h1>Regime Shifts</h1>

      <p>
        My undergraduate research focused on the dynamics of regime shifts in lake ecosystems, in which ecosystems transition between predator-dominant and forage-fish-dominant regimes. Using a two-patch tri-trophic food web model, I explored how predator-prey interactions and spatial heterogeneity influence these transitions.
